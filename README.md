Final Project


A. What have you built? Describe your project in a short paragraph
- A program to keep track of banking accounts. It takes in their ID, Account name, Balance, and Account type. It then takes all that data, and stores it into a text file. Which the program will read from everytime it starts. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one. 

B. How does it work? What all features does it have? Describe each feature/functionality. If you are able to, include screenshots of the output (not of the code)
- At the start of the program, it will read from a text file to see if there was any previous data. 
- It will then ask the user if they want to start any new accounts. 
- Afterwards it gives them the option to withdraw from any of the accounts, or deposit. Aswell as an option to save all accounts, and exit the program.
